# Active Context: Current Project State

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Objective
Memory Bank initialization for the Oikotie Real Estate Scraper project. This is the first establishment of the project documentation system to enable consistent knowledge transfer across development sessions.

### Recent Activities
1. **Memory Bank Setup** (Current Session)
   - Created foundational Memory Bank documentation structure
   - Documented project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context
   - Established baseline understanding of existing codebase

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank Initialization**
   - Finish progress.md documentation
   - Validate all Memory Bank files are comprehensive
   - Test Memory Bank workflow for future sessions

2. **Project Assessment**
   - Run system health checks to understand current state
   - Check database status and data pipeline functionality
   - Identify any immediate issues or maintenance needs

3. **Development Planning**
   - Prioritize pending features or improvements
   - Document any known issues or technical debt
   - Plan next development iteration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Memory Bank Implementation**: Following hierarchical documentation structure
- **Documentation First**: Prioritizing comprehensive project knowledge capture
- **Tool Integration**: Leveraging existing project tools and patterns

### Current Development Environment
- **Platform**: Windows 11 development environment
- **Python Version**: 3.13.2 (meets project requirements)
- **Package Management**: UV-based workflow
- **Editor**: VSCode with project integration

### Key Patterns and Preferences

#### Documentation Standards
- **Memory Bank Priority**: Complete documentation before code changes
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Building documentation in dependency order
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Including both technical and business context
- **Future-Proof Format**: Markdown for accessibility and version control

#### Development Workflow
- **Script-Based Pipeline**: Prefer direct Python execution over complex frameworks
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between scraping, processing, and visualization
- **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based settings for flexible operation
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive logging and fallback systems

#### Code Quality Approach
- **Type Safety**: Modern Python practices with type hints
- **Testing Integration**: pytest-based test suite
- **Dependency Management**: UV for reproducible environments
- **Documentation**: Inline and external documentation standards

## Project Insights and Learnings

### System Design Strengths
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between components
2. **Analytics Focus**: DuckDB choice optimizes for analytical workloads
3. **Geospatial Integration**: Comprehensive geographic data processing
4. **Research Oriented**: Jupyter notebook integration for exploratory analysis

### Technical Highlights
1. **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threaded scraping with configurable workers
2. **Data Reliability**: JSON fallback systems for database failures
3. **Extensibility**: Configuration-driven approach for adding new cities
4. **Modern Stack**: Contemporary Python ecosystem with proven libraries

### Potential Areas for Enhancement
1. **Monitoring**: Could benefit from more comprehensive system monitoring
2. **Automation**: Scheduling and automated pipeline execution
3. **Data Validation**: Enhanced data quality checks and validation
4. **User Interface**: Potential for dashboard or web interface development

## Current System State

### Known Functional Components
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium-based Oikotie.fi scraper
- **Data Storage**: DuckDB database with structured schema
- **Geolocation**: Address geocoding and standardization
- **Visualization**: Folium-based interactive mapping
- **Analysis**: Jupyter notebook integration

### Configuration Status
- **Helsinki Scraping**: Enabled and configured
- **Espoo Scraping**: Configured but disabled
- **Database Schema**: Established with comprehensive property fields
- **Worker Limits**: Configured for respectful scraping (5 workers max)

### Development Tools Ready
- **Testing Framework**: pytest configuration complete
- **Package Management**: UV environment and dependencies
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive script documentation in docs/
- **Version Control**: Git repository with proper .gitignore

## Context for Next Session

### Memory Bank Status
- **Initialization**: In progress (4/6 core files complete)
- **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive baseline established
- **Next Session Prep**: Will have complete project context available

### System Readiness
- **Environment**: Fully configured development environment
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed and verified
- **Documentation**: Complete technical and business context captured
- **Codebase**: Stable foundation with clear architecture

### Priority Actions for Continuation
1. Complete Memory Bank with progress.md
2. Perform system health check and status assessment
3. Run basic functionality tests
4. Identify immediate development priorities
5. Plan next feature development or maintenance tasks

## Important Notes

### Memory Bank Workflow
- This represents the first complete Memory Bank initialization
- Future sessions should begin by reading ALL Memory Bank files
- Active context should be updated with current work focus
- Progress tracking should reflect completed and pending work

### Project Continuity
- All essential project knowledge now documented
- Technical context sufficient for development continuation
- Business context clear for feature prioritization
- Architecture documented for system modifications
