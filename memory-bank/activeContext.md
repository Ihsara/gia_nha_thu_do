# Active Context: Current Project State

## Current Work Focus

**Property Polygon Visualization Development**
- Creating comprehensive analysis script to link listings to Helsinki property polygons  
- Implementing spatial joins and data aggregation capabilities
- Developing interactive map visualization with polygon boundaries
- Building master property table with aggregated listing statistics

**Critical Project Management Note**: This project uses **UV** for Python package management, not pip or conda. All Python commands must be executed using `uv run` prefix.

### Recent Activities (Current Session)
1. **Memory Bank Review** (Completed)
   - Read all Memory Bank files to understand project context
   - Confirmed project uses UV for package management
   - Identified current task: Property Polygon Visualization script execution

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Execute Property Polygon Visualization Script** (Priority)
   ```bash
   uv run python create_property_polygon_visualization.py
   ```

2. **Verify Output Generation**
   - Check that all 4 output files are created in `output/` directory
   - Confirm interactive map displays properly in browser
   - Validate master table contains expected property aggregations

3. **Memory Bank Documentation Update**
   - Document completed property polygon visualization work
   - Update progress.md with current achievements
   - Ensure UV usage is consistently documented across all contexts

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Memory Bank Implementation**: Following hierarchical documentation structure
- **Documentation First**: Prioritizing comprehensive project knowledge capture
- **Tool Integration**: Leveraging existing project tools and patterns

### Current Development Environment
- **Platform**: Windows 11 development environment
- **Python Version**: 3.13.2 (meets project requirements)
- **Package Management**: UV-based workflow
- **Editor**: VSCode with project integration

### Key Patterns and Preferences

#### Documentation Standards
- **Memory Bank Priority**: Complete documentation before code changes
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Building documentation in dependency order
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Including both technical and business context
- **Future-Proof Format**: Markdown for accessibility and version control

#### Development Workflow
- **Script-Based Pipeline**: Prefer direct Python execution over complex frameworks
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between scraping, processing, and visualization
- **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based settings for flexible operation
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive logging and fallback systems

#### Code Quality Approach
- **Type Safety**: Modern Python practices with type hints
- **Testing Integration**: pytest-based test suite
- **Dependency Management**: UV for reproducible environments
- **Documentation**: Inline and external documentation standards

## Project Insights and Learnings

### System Design Strengths
1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between components
2. **Analytics Focus**: DuckDB choice optimizes for analytical workloads
3. **Geospatial Integration**: Comprehensive geographic data processing
4. **Research Oriented**: Jupyter notebook integration for exploratory analysis

### Technical Highlights
1. **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threaded scraping with configurable workers
2. **Data Reliability**: JSON fallback systems for database failures
3. **Extensibility**: Configuration-driven approach for adding new cities
4. **Modern Stack**: Contemporary Python ecosystem with proven libraries

### Potential Areas for Enhancement
1. **Monitoring**: Could benefit from more comprehensive system monitoring
2. **Automation**: Scheduling and automated pipeline execution
3. **Data Validation**: Enhanced data quality checks and validation
4. **User Interface**: Potential for dashboard or web interface development

## Current System State

### Known Functional Components
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium-based Oikotie.fi scraper
- **Data Storage**: DuckDB database with structured schema
- **Geolocation**: Address geocoding and standardization
- **Visualization**: Folium-based interactive mapping
- **Analysis**: Jupyter notebook integration

### Configuration Status
- **Helsinki Scraping**: Enabled and configured
- **Espoo Scraping**: Configured but disabled
- **Database Schema**: Established with comprehensive property fields
- **Worker Limits**: Configured for respectful scraping (5 workers max)

### Development Tools Ready
- **Testing Framework**: pytest configuration complete
- **Package Management**: UV environment and dependencies
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive script documentation in docs/
- **Version Control**: Git repository with proper .gitignore

## Context for Next Session

### Memory Bank Status
- **Initialization**: In progress (4/6 core files complete)
- **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive baseline established
- **Next Session Prep**: Will have complete project context available

### System Readiness
- **Environment**: Fully configured development environment
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed and verified
- **Documentation**: Complete technical and business context captured
- **Codebase**: Stable foundation with clear architecture

### Priority Actions for Continuation
1. Complete Memory Bank with progress.md
2. Perform system health check and status assessment
3. Run basic functionality tests
4. Identify immediate development priorities
5. Plan next feature development or maintenance tasks

## Important Notes

### Memory Bank Workflow
- This represents the first complete Memory Bank initialization
- Future sessions should begin by reading ALL Memory Bank files
- Active context should be updated with current work focus
- Progress tracking should reflect completed and pending work

### Project Continuity
- All essential project knowledge now documented
- Technical context sufficient for development continuation
- Business context clear for feature prioritization
- Architecture documented for system modifications
