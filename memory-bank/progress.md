## Known Issues

### OSM Integration Issues
1. **Column Name Mismatch**: DuckDB expects `geometry` but OSM data uses `geom`
2. **Geographic CRS Warnings**: Distance calculations need projected coordinate system
3. **Buffer Distance Tuning**: Current 100m buffer may not be optimal for all areas
4. **Edge Case Matching**: Some addresses don't match to nearest building within buffer

### Technical Debt
1. **Coordinate System Optimization**: Geographic vs projected CRS for distance calculations
2. **Memory Usage**: Large building polygon datasets require significant RAM
3. **Spatial Index Optimization**: R-tree indexing could improve query performance
4. **Error Recovery**: Some spatial operation failures need better handling

### External Dependencies
1. **Geofabrik Updates**: Building data currency depends on OSM update frequency
2. **OSM Data Quality**: Building footprint completeness varies by area
3. **Browser Updates**: Chrome/Chromium version compatibility for scraping
4. **Geocoding Limits**: Rate limiting from external geocoding services

### Performance Considerations
1. **Large Dataset Processing**: 79K+ buildings require efficient spatial operations
2. **Memory Consumption**: Building footprint processing requires substantial RAM
3. **Parallel Processing**: Optimal worker count depends on system resources
4. **Storage Requirements**: Building polygon data significantly increases storage needs
