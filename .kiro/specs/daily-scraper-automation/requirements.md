# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a daily automated scraper system for the Oikotie Real Estate Analytics Platform. The system will provide intelligent, scheduled data collection with smart deduplication, deployment flexibility, status reporting, and adherence to established development standards.

The automated scraper will transform the current manual execution model into a production-ready, self-managing system that can be deployed across various environments while maintaining data quality and operational visibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Daily Execution

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the scraper to run automatically every day without re-processing already collected listings, so that I have fresh data without wasting computational resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily scraper runs THEN it SHALL check the database for existing listings before scraping
2. WHEN a listing URL already exists in the database with a recent timestamp THEN the system SHALL skip re-scraping that listing
3. WHEN determining "recent" data THEN the system SHALL use a configurable staleness threshold (default: 24 hours)
4. WHEN new listings are discovered THEN the system SHALL prioritize these for immediate processing
5. WHEN listings have been updated on the source site THEN the system SHALL detect changes and re-scrape accordingly
6. WHEN the scraper encounters previously failed URLs THEN it SHALL retry them with exponential backoff
7. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL log statistics of new, updated, and skipped listings

### Requirement 2: Flexible Deployment Architecture

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the scraper as either a container, standalone application, or cluster service, so that I can choose the deployment model that fits my infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying as a container THEN the system SHALL provide a Docker image with all dependencies
2. WHEN deploying as a standalone application THEN the system SHALL run on any machine with Python 3.9+
3. WHEN deploying to a cluster THEN the system SHALL support distributed execution with work coordination
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variables and config files
5. WHEN database access is required THEN the system SHALL support both local and remote DuckDB connections
6. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL adapt browser automation (headless vs GUI)
7. WHEN scaling horizontally THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate work across multiple instances
8. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include health check endpoints for monitoring

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Status Reporting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to receive daily status reports about scraper execution, so that I can monitor system health and data collection progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily scraper completes THEN it SHALL generate a comprehensive status report
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include metrics on listings processed, errors encountered, and performance statistics
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them (network, parsing, database, etc.) and provide actionable information
4. WHEN reporting status THEN the system SHALL include data quality metrics and validation results
5. WHEN the scraper runs THEN it SHALL track execution time, memory usage, and resource consumption
6. WHEN multiple cities are configured THEN the system SHALL provide per-city breakdown in reports
7. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL be available in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, email)
8. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts via configured channels
9. WHEN historical data is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain execution history and trends

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Data Storage

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want scraped data stored in the designated DuckDB database with proper schema and data governance, so that I can perform reliable analytics on clean, structured data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use the single DuckDB database strategy (`data/real_estate.duckdb`)
2. WHEN inserting listings THEN the system SHALL follow the established schema with proper data types and constraints
3. WHEN duplicate listings are detected THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than creating duplicates
4. WHEN data quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL log them and apply data governance rules
5. WHEN geocoding addresses THEN the system SHALL store results in the `address_locations` table
6. WHEN processing building data THEN the system SHALL integrate with OSM building footprints when available
7. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL use JSON fallback storage as defined in current architecture
8. WHEN storing metadata THEN the system SHALL track data lineage, fetch timestamps, and quality scores
9. WHEN archiving data THEN the system SHALL implement soft deletion with `deleted_ts` timestamps

### Requirement 5: Development Standards Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the automated scraper to follow all established development standards and patterns, so that it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase and maintains code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the scraper THEN it SHALL follow the progressive validation strategy (10 → 100 → full scale testing)
2. WHEN creating expensive operations THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive bug prevention tests
3. WHEN making database operations THEN it SHALL use the established DuckDB utilities and connection patterns
4. WHEN handling external APIs THEN it SHALL follow data governance rules for respectful usage and rate limiting
5. WHEN processing spatial data THEN it SHALL integrate with the OSM building footprint architecture
6. WHEN implementing error handling THEN it SHALL follow the error documentation system requirements
7. WHEN creating configuration THEN it SHALL use the established JSON configuration patterns
8. WHEN logging operations THEN it SHALL use the loguru logging framework with structured output
9. WHEN implementing tests THEN it SHALL create both unit tests and integration tests following pytest patterns

### Requirement 6: Operational Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the automated scraper, so that I can ensure reliable operation and quickly respond to issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraper runs THEN it SHALL expose metrics for monitoring systems (Prometheus-compatible)
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on slow execution times
3. WHEN error rates increase THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts based on configurable thresholds
4. WHEN data quality drops THEN the system SHALL alert on geocoding failures or validation issues
5. WHEN external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL detect and report service unavailability
6. WHEN disk space is low THEN the system SHALL warn before database storage issues occur
7. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL monitor and report resource consumption
8. WHEN the scraper fails to start THEN it SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
9. WHEN scheduled execution is missed THEN the system SHALL alert and attempt recovery

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options for the automated scraper, so that I can adapt it to different environments and requirements without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring cities THEN the system SHALL support adding new cities through configuration files
2. WHEN setting schedules THEN the system SHALL support cron-like scheduling expressions
3. WHEN configuring workers THEN the system SHALL allow tuning of concurrency and rate limiting
4. WHEN setting up notifications THEN the system SHALL support multiple alert channels (email, Slack, webhooks)
5. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL support different database connection strings and paths
6. WHEN setting data retention THEN the system SHALL support configurable archival and cleanup policies
7. WHEN configuring validation THEN the system SHALL allow customization of data quality thresholds
8. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configuration overrides
9. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL provide plugin interfaces for custom processors
