# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature expands the Oikotie Real Estate Analytics Platform to fully support Espoo city with the same comprehensive functionality currently available for Helsinki. The expansion includes enabling Espoo scraping, updating all documentation, integrating Espoo-specific geospatial data sources, and ensuring the daily automation system works seamlessly for both cities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Espoo Data Collection Enablement

**User Story:** As a real estate researcher, I want to collect property listings from Espoo with the same reliability and features as Helsinki, so that I can conduct comparative analysis between Finland's two largest cities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured for Espoo THEN it SHALL enable Espoo scraping with proper rate limiting and smart deduplication
2. WHEN Espoo scraping runs THEN it SHALL collect property listings with the same data quality as Helsinki using DuckDB single database strategy
3. WHEN the daily automation system executes THEN it SHALL process both Helsinki and Espoo listings with comprehensive error handling and audit logging
4. WHEN storing Espoo data THEN it SHALL maintain data lineage tracking, quality scoring, and proper schema constraints
5. IF Espoo scraping encounters errors THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, and comprehensive error cataloging

### Requirement 2: Geospatial Data Integration for Espoo

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want Espoo properties to have the same geospatial enrichment as Helsinki properties, so that I can perform spatial analysis across both cities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Espoo listings THEN the system SHALL integrate with Espoo municipal geospatial data sources following data governance rules (max 1 request/second, database-first strategy)
2. WHEN geocoding Espoo addresses THEN the system SHALL achieve >95% accuracy similar to Helsinki with proper coordinate validation (EPSG:4326)
3. WHEN building footprint matching is performed THEN Espoo properties SHALL have OSM building polygon integration with spatial index optimization
4. WHEN accessing external APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting, caching, and data lineage tracking
5. IF Espoo-specific geospatial APIs are available THEN the system SHALL integrate them with bulk download preference and permanent database storage

### Requirement 3: Documentation and Configuration Updates

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want comprehensive documentation for Espoo functionality, so that I can deploy and use the system effectively for both cities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the README THEN it SHALL include Espoo examples and configuration guidance
2. WHEN checking configuration files THEN they SHALL have proper Espoo settings and examples
3. WHEN following deployment guides THEN they SHALL work for both Helsinki and Espoo deployments
4. WHEN using CLI commands THEN they SHALL support city-specific operations for Espoo

### Requirement 4: Visualization and Dashboard Support

**User Story:** As a real estate analyst, I want interactive dashboards and visualizations for Espoo properties, so that I can explore and analyze Espoo market data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating dashboards THEN the system SHALL support Espoo city selection
2. WHEN creating visualizations THEN Espoo properties SHALL display with proper map boundaries and styling
3. WHEN using enhanced dashboard features THEN Espoo building footprints SHALL render correctly
4. WHEN comparing cities THEN the system SHALL support multi-city visualization modes

### Requirement 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive testing for Espoo functionality, so that I can ensure reliable operation in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running validation tests THEN they SHALL include Espoo-specific test cases following progressive validation strategy (10 → 100 → full scale)
2. WHEN performing bug prevention tests THEN they SHALL validate all Espoo operations before expensive pipeline execution (>10 minutes)
3. WHEN executing integration tests THEN they SHALL validate Espoo data collection and processing with 100% pass rate requirement
4. WHEN running progressive validation THEN it SHALL achieve ≥95% match rate for 10-sample, ≥98% for medium scale, and ≥99.40% for full scale
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN it SHALL track Espoo-specific metrics and performance with comprehensive error cataloging

### Requirement 6: Database Schema and Migration Compliance

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want Espoo data integration to follow proper database management standards, so that data integrity and performance are maintained across both cities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Espoo data THEN the system SHALL use the single DuckDB database strategy with proper schema documentation
2. WHEN creating database migrations THEN they SHALL include versioned migration scripts with rollback procedures
3. WHEN storing Espoo data THEN it SHALL enforce spatial data constraints (EPSG:4326, geometry validation, coordinate bounds)
4. WHEN implementing indexes THEN it SHALL create proper spatial indexes for Espoo geometries following performance optimization standards
5. WHEN handling data integrity THEN it SHALL maintain foreign key constraints and prevent orphaned records

### Requirement 7: Production Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the expanded system to production with both Helsinki and Espoo support, so that automated data collection works reliably for both cities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL support both cities in all deployment modes (standalone, container, Kubernetes, Helm)
2. WHEN running daily automation THEN it SHALL process both cities with smart deduplication and database-first approach
3. WHEN monitoring production systems THEN it SHALL provide city-specific health metrics, comprehensive error handling, and audit logging
4. WHEN scaling cluster operations THEN it SHALL distribute work efficiently with Redis-based coordination and exponential backoff retry logic
5. WHEN handling failures THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and maintain data lineage tracking
