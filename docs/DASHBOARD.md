# Dashboard

This project uses a [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) dashboard to visualize the scraped real estate data.

For instructions on how to run the dashboard, please refer to the main `README.md` file.

The dashboard provides the following features:

-   **Key Metrics**: Displays the total number of listings, average price, and average price per square meter.
-   **Data Table**: An aggregated table of listings by postal code and housing type.
-   **Listing Density Heatmap**: A map that visualizes the concentration of listings across different postal codes.
-   **Price Range Road Map**: A map displaying individual listings, colored by price range.
