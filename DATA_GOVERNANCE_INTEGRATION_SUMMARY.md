- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improvement
- **Formats**: JSON and HTML report generation

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Database Integration
- **Schema Extensions**: Added governance fields to existing tables
- **Migration Support**: Database migration scripts for governance tables
- **Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing queries and operations

### Automation Integration
- **Orchestrator Enhancement**: Extended `EnhancedScraperOrchestrator` with governance features

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error documentation and handling
- **Git Workflow**: Conventional commits and proper branching
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation and examples

## Configuration

### Data Governance Rules (`config/data_governance.json`)
```json
{
  "api_rate_limits": {
    "oikotie.fi": {
      "max_requests_per_second": 1.0,
      "max_requests_per_hour": 3600
    },
    "hri.fi": {
      "max_requests_per_second": 0.5,
      "max_requests_per_hour": 1800
    }
  },
  "data_quality_thresholds": {
    "minimum_completeness": 0.7,
    "minimum_accuracy": 0.8,
    "minimum_consistency": 0.6,
    "minimum_timeliness": 0.5
  },

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from oikotie.automation.data_governance import DataGovernanceManager

# Initialize governance manager
governance = DataGovernanceManager()

# Calculate data quality score
listing_data = {...}
quality_score = governance.calculate_data_quality_score(listing_data)
print(f"Quality Score: {quality_score.overall_score:.2f}")

# Generate compliance report
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
report = governance.generate_compliance_report(
    datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7),
    datetime.now()
)
```

### Integrated Orchestrator
```python
from oikotie.automation.governance_integration import GovernanceIntegratedOrchestrator
from oikotie.automation.orchestrator import ScraperConfig

config = ScraperConfig(city="Helsinki", url="...", ...)
orchestrator = GovernanceIntegratedOrchestrator(config)

# Run scraping with governance
result = orchestrator.run_daily_scrape()
print(f"Governance metrics: {result.governance_metrics}")
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Initialize configuration
uv run python -m oikotie.automation.governance_cli init-config

# Generate compliance report
